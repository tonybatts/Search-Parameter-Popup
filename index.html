        This pen grabs the search query from a URL and shows a customized popup based on the search query.

        I created this when two companies merged and wanted users clicking on their old site links to be informed of the merge. The old sites were redirected to the new site with a search parameter specific to those sites. 
      <p>
      <p>
        The buttons below add a string qeury to the current URL. In your build you will simply add that search parameter in your 301 redirect, I am doing it here simply for demonstation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the console tab at the bottom of this pen and you will see the current URL change.

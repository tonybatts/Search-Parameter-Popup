# Search-Parameter-Popup
*Custom popup based on the current search parameter*

## This code will let you show a custom popup based on a search parameter in the url. The example code attached changes the url parameter via two buttons. In actual production you would pass the search paramater in whichever way you need and simply just call the code

I created this when two companies merged and wanted users clicking on their old site links to be informed of the merge. The old sites were redirected to the new site with a search parameter specific to those sites.

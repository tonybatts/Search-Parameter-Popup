# Search-Parameter-Popup
*Custom popup based on the current search parameter*

## This code will let you show a custom popup based on a search parameter in the url. The example code attached changes the url parameter via two buttons. In actual production you would pass the search paramater in whichever way you need and simply just call the code

About a year ago i was looking for cool raspberry pi projects to do. I stumbled across one that I immediately new 
I needed to build, The Simpsons Shuffler by Stephen Coyle. After hours of building and making the code he provided work for 
me and my needs (and a little help from Stephen himself) I had a Raspberry Pi Zero W that shuffles episodes of the simpsons on button push and ALSO safely turned off the pi on a long button press. 

I posted my project to reddit and have been recieving requests for help ever since. As it turns out, there is no step by step guide for this project, and none that include a power off feature. Until now!
